Miner boot order sequence.

Apon boot the HW will try to load the uboot from SD/EMMC based on the boot-select. So if SDcard present, the uboot in sdcard will be prefered. 

Then the uboot tryes to locate uImage+spondoolies.dtb in the following order: sd-card, EMMC, TFTP.


After the linux image is loaded, it will try to mount the following directories (see /etc/init.d/S85mount):
/sd      - sd card data
/mmc     - mmc data
/nfs     - nfs server
/my_nfs  - link to /nfs/<hostname>
/nvm     - link to /sd or /mmc

After that it will try to do the following:

execute /sd/autorun 
execute /mmc/autorun 
execute /my_nfs/autorun                      #used to small incremental updates 
execute /my_nfs/autorun-once and delete it.  #this is used for system upgrade (uImage, u-boot.img) and /nvm/cgminer.conf upgrade
store IP in /my_nfs/my_ip and date in /my_nfs/boot_date and copy nvm.bin to /my_nfs/nvm.bin

After that, !only if no /sd/autorun and no /mmc/autorun were found!, the system will try to do the following:
- load fpga
- start miner_gate_arm (in infinite loop) 
- start cgminer with config file /nvm/cgminer.conf. If file not present, /spond-data/cgminer.conf will be used. 

Every 15 seconds the minergate will store zabbix.bin in the /my_nfs/ directory. The file should be used by zabbix to create monitoring graphs and notifications. 


In case of cgminer/miner_gate_arm failure the syslog will be stored in /my_nfs/syslog.log and notification should be created.




On the other side the host will be able to monitor
