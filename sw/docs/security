The Spondoolies system will be made of the following components:

-Miners
-Proxy servers running proxy applications.
-Control server with Mysql and Web-interface

None of the components will ever have private keys of the wallets. The money will be stored initially in our account 
at the pool-operator or in temporary mining wallet, and in the end of each day it will be transfered to company storage wallets,
where multiple keys will be needed to transfer them to other account.



Miners can work in 2 modes:
- Standalone mode    - CG miner
- With proxy - CG miner with modifications to talk to our proxy server


2 types of wallets 
- Mining wallets - never keep more then 1 day worth of mining
- Storage wallets - for long time BC storage, needs multiple signatures


Proxy server proccess
- Takes job-template (getworktemplate or stratum) from Pool (3rd party), devides job-templates to registered miners (stratum).
- Proxy servers are HARD-CODED with the MINING WALLETS and can not be configured to mine to other wallets.
Proxy servers will accept requests only from preconfigured IP ranges (pools, miners and control server).


Control server (Mysql backend + Web front end)
- Monitoring (mySQL + Web Interface) performance (by saving reports in mysql)
- Configuring miners and proxy proccesses (mySQL + Web Interface) - saving in Mysql and sending configuration to miners. 

The control servers will be located in the cluster or in the cloud.
